# TOOLTIP 

- In this file, shown the exact contribution of order priority on the basis of sales for every year, quarter,month, category, market, segment.

- When we hover the cursor on any of the graph of summary dashboard page then it is reflecting the order priority for that perticular graph. So here the "TOOLTIP" concept has been used.

- For that created a new page i.e, Summary for Tool_Tip_OrederPriority, allow that page as Tooltip from page information. And put all the graph related to order priority on the basis of sales, profit,quantity and discount.

- Then from summary dashboard page, assign the "Summary for Tool_Tip_OrederPriority" as tooltip for each and every graph.
